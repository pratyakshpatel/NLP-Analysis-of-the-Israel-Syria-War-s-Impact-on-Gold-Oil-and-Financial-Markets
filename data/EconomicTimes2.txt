Following the killing of Hezbollah's Nasrallah by Israel, fears of a larger conflict involving Iran and the US have arisen, impacting global markets and energy supplies. AP An Israeli tank moves next to soldiers as they stand atop of armoured personnel carriers (APC), in northern Israel The market capitalisation of all listed companies on the BSE fell by Rs 3.55 lakh crore to Rs 474.38 lakh crore on Monday as benchmark equity indices, Sensex and Nifty, registering biggest decline in nearly two months. One of the several reasons for the stock market scare was the possibility of a bigger war breaking out in the Middle East which will disrupt energy and other important supplies. After sensational pager attacks on Hezbollah and killing Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, Israel is said to be preparing for ground invasion of Lebanon which can lead to a bigger war. Hezbollah has vastly better military capabilities than Hamas . Its military might equals that of a midsized country, as per an Israel Defence Force (IDF) estimate. An Israeli airstrike hit an apartment building in Beirut in Lebanon on Monday due to which tensions in the region have escalated to a new level. This incident marks the first attack within Beirut city limits amid increasing hostilities between Israel and Iran's allies. Israel has also conducted strikes against the Houthi militia in Yemen, heightening concerns about a broader conflict in the region which may draw in Iran and the United States. Hezbollah deputy chief Naim Kassem has vowed to continue the fight. In his first speech after Nasrallah's death, Kassem asserted that despite the loss of top military commanders in recent months, Hezbollah's capabilities remain unaffected, and the organization has deputy commanders and replacements ready to step in. Hashem Safieddine, one of Nasrallah's cousins and Hezbollah’s most prominent figures, is likely to become the next leader of Hezbollah. Safieddine has strong ties with Iran and his son is married to the daughter of General Qassim Suleimani, the commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards’ foreign operations arm who was killed in a 2020 US strike in Iraq. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah would be avenged and his path in fighting Israel would be continued by other militants. What are Israel's plans? The Middle East has turned into a tinderbox with Israel's aggressive strikes on Hezbollah and the Houthis in Yemen before an impending invasion of Lebanon.

The raids, which have included entering Hezbollah’s tunnels located along the border, have occurred recently as well as over the past months, part of the broader effort by Israel to degrade Hezbollah’s capabilities along the border dividing Israel and Lebanon, the people said. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant strongly hinted that Israel is preparing to launch a ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon, The Times of Israel reported. “The elimination of [Hezbollah terror chief Hassan] Nasrallah is a very important step, but it is not everything. We will use all the capabilities we have,” Gallant told troops of the 188th Armored Brigade and Golani Infantry Brigade in northern Israel. “If someone on the other side does not understand what these capabilities mean, it is all capabilities and you are part of this effort. We trust you to be able to accomplish anything,” he said. Dan Schueftan, a former advisor to two Israeli PMs, has written in TOI that while all parties involved fear the widening of the Lebanon conflict, Tel Aviv doesn’t have a choice but to continue till it massively weakens its adversaries. The US military said on Sunday it was increasing its air support capabilities in the Middle East and putting troops on a heightened readiness to deploy to the region as it warned Iran against expanding the ongoing conflict. The announcement came two days after President Joe Biden directed the Pentagon to adjust US force posture in the Middle East amid intensifying concern that Israel's killing of Nasrallah could prompt Tehran to retaliate. Pentagon had reportedly expressed displeasure over Israel taking out Nasrallah without informing it well in advance, signifying the fear of the kiling tirggering a wider conflict. What is Iran's strategy? A full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah could be far more devastating than the 34-day conflict in 2006, which left over 1,200 people dead in Lebanon and 160 in Israel. Hezbollah, a powerful militia backed by Iran, is believed to have amassed an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles, many of which are capable of hitting major Israeli cities. The timing is particularly sensitive, given that Israel is still engaged in a protracted conflict with Hamas in Gaza. A two-front war with Hamas in the south and Hezbollah in the north would stretch Israel’s military capabilities and create a broader regional conflict. A full-scale Israel-Hezbollah war can draw in Iran and Syria and the US, turning it into an even bigger conflict. Iran, Hezbollah’s primary benefactor, now faces a strategic dilemma. For years, Hezbollah has acted as Iran’s deterrent against Israeli aggression. Its missile stockpiles and military capabilities were designed to counter any Israeli attempt to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities. Now, with Hezbollah weakened, Iran must decide whether to retaliate or recalibrate its strategy. So far, Iran’s response has been muted. President Masoud Pezeshkian, while stopping short of threatening direct retaliation, has warned that Nasrallah’s death will have consequences. Yet Tehran appears cautious, likely unwilling to escalate tensions further at a time when its own economy is under strain from international sanctions. According to Vali Nasr, a former high-ranking State Department adviser and current professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, it is improbable that Tehran will take overt measures to support Hezbollah. “Iran is not ready right now because it’s not the right time,” Vali Nasr told the Wall Street Journal. “But there will be a right time.” Iran’s reluctance to retaliate immediately may also stem from the broader geopolitical shifts taking place in the region. Saudi Arabia and other Sunni-led states, which have historically been at odds with Iran, have been quietly supportive of Israel’s moves against Hezbollah, seeing the group as a destabilizing force in the region. While Saudi Arabia has publicly called for peace, its silence on Nasrallah’s death signals a shift in the regional dynamics.
