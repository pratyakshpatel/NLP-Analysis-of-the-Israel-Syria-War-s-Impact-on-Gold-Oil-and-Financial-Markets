Listen to Story Live TV Share Advertisement Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri. India Today Business Desk New Delhi , UPDATED: Oct 9, 2023 13:10 IST The world's third-largest oil importer, India, is closely monitoring the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, said Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri. His statement comes as global crude oil prices surged by over $3 per barrel on Monday due to escalating military clashes between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas , which have increased political uncertainty in the Middle East and raised concerns about oil supplies. advertisement Speaking at an industry event in New Delhi, Puri said the significance of the region where the conflict is unfolding, describing it as a central hub of global energy. He reassured that India would navigate through the evolving situation. "The place where action is taking place is in many respects the centre of global energy... as we go along we will navigate through this," Puri was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters. Puri also noted that global uncertainties of this nature tend to encourage the adoption of sustainable, cleaner fuels. He added that crude oil prices at $100 per barrel are unsustainable. Higher oil prices typically result in increased inflation and adversely affect the growth of large-scale importers like India. Last week, Puri had urged oil-producing nations to exhibit "sensitivity" toward consuming countries , which have been grappling with prices consistently trading above $90 per barrel, following Saudi Arabia and Russia's decision to extend voluntary production cuts through the end of the year.
