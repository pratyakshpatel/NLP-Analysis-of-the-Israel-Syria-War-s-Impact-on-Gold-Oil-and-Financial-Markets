Why bulls have made peace with war By Nikhil Agarwal , ETMarkets.com Last Updated: Oct 11, 2023, 01:10:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis "The decline in the dollar index to 105.95 and the US 10-year bond yield falling to 4.65 from the recent high of 4.88 are positive developments for equity markets. Even though FIIs continue to sell in India, the intensity of selling is coming down. More importantly. DIIs are increasing their purchases," said Dr V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services. Sensex surges 600 pts, regains 66K as global markets rebound; Nifty near 19,700 NEW DELHI: As the war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas entered the fourth day today, Sensex recovered Monday's loss to jump 600 points while Nifty crossed the hurdle at the 19,700 level. Small and midcap stocks, which faced most of the wrath in the previous session, sprung back to life quickly to reverse the losses. Buying was spread across sectors and market segments as the only major index trading lower was fear gauge indicator India VIX which slipped 2%. Banks and auto stocks were among the top gainers while Nifty Realty rallied over 4% to hit a new 15-year high on robust industry sales in Q2. The Middle East distraction proved short-lived for Dalal Street bulls as US bond yields fell, Brent crude oil rates stabilised, and global markets staged a recovery. "The decline in the dollar index to 105.95 and the US 10-year bond yield falling to 4.65 from the recent high of 4.88 are positive developments for equity markets. Even though FIIs continue to sell in India, the intensity of selling is coming down. More importantly. DIIs are increasing their purchases," said Dr V K Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services . Amid fears of a broader conflict and the possibility of Iran getting drawn into the battlefield, crude oil prices soared by 4% in the previous session. The safe-haven appeal of gold , dollar, and US Treasury futures had gone up.

Higher oil prices and the risk of sustained higher inflation rates will keep the yields high in the developed markets but we see limited impact on the global economy from the conflict in its current state," said smallcase manager Ashwini Shami of OmniScience Capital. Analysts are suggesting investors see the dip as a buying opportunity as domestic economic growth remains robust. "The Israel-Hamas conflict, though intense, is limited to a very specific area and is unlikely to trigger an immediate market reaction. During geopolitical turmoil, investors tend to make safer choices and gravitate towards precious metals. At the same time, they do not abandon equities either, as they expect them to perform better once stability returns," Sarvjeet Virk, Co-Founder & MD, Finvasia. However, while the market may have ignored geopolitical tensions in the near term, the uncertainty associated with the Israel-Hamas war continues. Barring stock-specific action as a result of the Q2 earnings season, which begins tomorrow with TCS releasing quarterly numbers, analysts see limited upside at the index level.
